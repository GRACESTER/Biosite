            <h3> Adam's Bio</h3>
            
            <!-- 3 paragraphs-->
            <p> My subject’s name is Adam. Adam is 24 years old and currently lives in Offutt AFB, Nebraska. He will soon be moving to San Angelo, Texas. Adam was born on a chilly November day in Toledo, Ohio. He lived in Toledo for most of his life with his mom, dad, 2 sisters and one brother. As a kid, he was incredibly involved in sports and a straight-A student. In grade school he played soccer, basketball, baseball, football, and also ran cross country. Therefore, in grade school Adam was busy year-round. In high school, he continued to play soccer and took up chess. He also did stage crew for the spring musical and was the stage manager. The reason that he did not play as many sports as in grade school was because he started working in high school. He worked at McDonald’s for a few years and then left McDonalds to work at a local bagel shop.  </p>
            <p> During Adam’s freshman year of college, he decided to join the United States Air Force. He did this in order to receive the educational benefits that the military offers. He also hoped to become a medical commissioned officer. Unfortunately, his medical officer dream did not work out because there wasn’t a choice to pick which field of medicine interested him. His training would have been solely based off of the needs of the Air Force. Instead, he is currently pursuing a degree in Biochemistry. He hopes to use his degree to become a chemistry teacher. </p>
            <p> In the next year, Adam plans on taking care of his new baby, working and pursuing his degree. He will also balance this by partaking in some of his favorite hobbies which include playing disc golf and watching UFC. In the next 5 years, he hopes to have more children and finish his degree. In 10 years, when he will likely move again, he hopes to buy another home and grow his financial portfolio. In 20 years, Adam hopes to retire from the Air Force and finally become a chemistry teacher at a nearby high school.</p>
