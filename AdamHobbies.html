                <p> Adam has played chess since he was 6 years old. He greatly enjoyed chess throughout his school years and hopes to teach his oldest daughter how to play shortly. </p>
                <p> Adam took up rock climbing as a hobby when he was first stationed in Texas. He used it to keep his mind off of being far away from home. He currently still rock climbs in Austin, Texas. </p>
                <p> Adam has been an avid golfer since highschool. Wherever he goes, he tends to find other people who share in his hobby. He hopes to play Quicksand golf course in the near future. </p>
